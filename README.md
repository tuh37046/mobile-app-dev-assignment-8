# Lab 8: Search
This project is build on what we did in Lab 7.  This is a library app that allows users to select from a shelf of randomly generated books. The user is prompted to select a book, and upon doing so is shown a detail screen that shows the book's full title and author.  The user can select and view books in landscape mode without launching a detail screen.
The user can search for a string token, and only book titles that match that token will be displayed.

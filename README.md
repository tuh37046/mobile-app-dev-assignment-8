# Lab 9: Audiobook Service
This project is built on what we did in Lab 8.  This is a library app that allows users to select from a shelf of books generated by a web API.
Upon being queried, the API provides a JSONArray of book objects that contain information about the books such as the book titles, and links to the book covers.
Upon selecting a book, the user can play the book using the AudiobookService library, and control playback by pausing, stopping, or seeking through the book.

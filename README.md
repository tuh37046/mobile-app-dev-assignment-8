# Lab 10: Audiobook Service Continued
This project is built on what we did in Lab 9.  This is a library app that allows users to select from a shelf of audiobooks generated by the Professor's web API.
Upon selecting a book, the user can play or resume, the selected book.  This feature persists through app closing, as well as the listening progress for all books in the API.
If the user plays a book that is not saved locally, the app automatically downloads the file and will play from local storage if the file already exists.
